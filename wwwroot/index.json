    "excerpt": "I aimed to streamline my workflow using a single machine but encountered limitations across platforms—Windows became unstable, Arch required excessive maintenance, and macOS lacked NVIDIA GPU support. \n\n Ultimately, I adopted a headless Linux setup accessed via SSH and VSCode with Dev Containers from my Mac. This approach offers stability, flexibility, and strong remote development capabilities—though GUI dependencies still remain unavoidable in some cases."

    "excerpt": "XR is being brought to the public again after Apple announced their new XR headset, Apple Vision Pro. However, Apple is hesitant about this product as, during WWDC, no one other than those featured in the promotion video was seen wearing it. The reason is obvious: using a computer that covers your face in front of a camera is weird (not to mention that it is way bigger than some other XR \"glasses\")."
